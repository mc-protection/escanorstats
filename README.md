# escanorstats

This is an opensource addon for Aegis Escanor 2.0+ which adds the ability for /aegis stats. Tradionally this was handled internaly within Aegis, however we chose to make it an addon to save resources for the people who do not use it. This also adds the posibility for much broader customization for our more advanced users.
